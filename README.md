## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting (Safari-specific)

If the app doesn't load correctly in Safari (you may see errors like "Outdated Optimize Dep" or cached files being used), try the following steps:

1. Enable the Develop menu in Safari (if not already enabled):
	- Open Safari Preferences ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí check "Show Develop menu in menu bar".

2. Empty Caches:
	- From the menu bar choose Develop ‚Üí Empty Caches.
	- This forces Safari to drop any cached dev server files that can cause stale optimized dependency responses.

3. Disable the Page Cache while testing (optional):
	- In the Develop menu, ensure "Disable Page Cache" (or "Use Page Cache") is set so Safari will always fetch fresh resources during development.

4. Hard reload the page:
	- Press Option+Command+R to perform a hard reload.

If issues persist, delete Vite's dev cache and restart the dev server:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
yarn dev
```

These steps fix the majority of caching-related issues you may see while developing with Vite and Safari.
