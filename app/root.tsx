/**
 * App root
 *
 * This file is the HTML shell for the app when using a server-rendering/SSR-capable
 * dev server (React Router dev). It composes the top-level providers that most
 * React apps need during development and learning:
 *
 * - QueryClientProvider: provides @tanstack/react-query functionality for data
 *   fetching, caching and background updates.
 * - ThemeProvider: supplies a theme object to styled-components so components
 *   can access design tokens like colors, spacing and radius via `theme`.
 * - FavoritesProvider: a small example of a React Context for shared state
 *   (persisted to localStorage in this project). This demonstrates global state
 *   without a heavy library.
 * - Outlet: where the current route (page) component is rendered by React Router.
 *
 * For learners: think of this file as the app "frame". Routes are rendered into
 * the <Outlet/>; everything higher up (theme, global styles, query client)
 * becomes available to those route components.

          Providers wrap the rendered app so any nested component can use them.
          Order matters slightly: ThemeProvider only needs to wrap where styled
          components are used; QueryClientProvider needs to wrap where
          useQuery/useMutation will be called. Keeping them together here is a
          simple, clear pattern for learners.
