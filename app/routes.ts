/**
 * Route configuration for React Router (dev)
 *
 * This array maps URL paths to the files that implement those routes. When the
 * app runs, React Router resolves the incoming URL and dynamically imports the
 * matching file (code-splitting each route automatically in dev/production).
 *
 * For learners: paths with `:` denote route params (eg `/pokemon/:name`) and
 * become available to the page via `useParams()`.
